## `$lookup stage, embedding vs referencing`

### Embedding

- **Faster Reads**: All data is in one document.
- **Simple Structure**: Fewer collections, easier to manage.
- **Atomic Updates**: Changes are contained within one document.
- **Limits**: Not suitable for large data; 16MB document size limit.
- **Best For**: Strongly related data, one-to-few or one-to-one relationships.

### Referencing

- **Reduced Document Size**: Only store references, not full data.
- **Normalized Data**: Less redundancy, better consistency.
- **Flexible Relationships**: Handles complex or growing data.
- **Extra Queries Needed**: Slower reads due to multiple lookups.
- **Best For**: Large, complex, or many-to-many relationships.

```js
db.orders.aggregate([
  {
    $lookup: {
      from: "test",
      localField: "userId", //local key
      foreignField: "_id", //foreign key
      as: "user",
    },
  },
]);
```
